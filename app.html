    <h2>Cross-Platform Desktop Application</h2>
    <p>
        I wanted to help people learn Cantonese (to watch Cantonese movies), so I pulled up a GitHub repo with a large
        database of Cantonese phonetic
        sound files, downloaded them, referenced them with another repo that mapped characters to their phonetic
        symbols, and
        created a desktop dictionary application using Electron and Node.js.
    </p>
    <p>
        The GUI was designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while file system operations were performed with Node.js
        through secure IPC.
        The main difficulty was the problem of multiple pitches of the same word, so querying had to be modified to
        show multiple sounds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Later I created a WYSIWYG editor froms sratch within the same Electron application, that indicated the pitches
        of
        words under the word itself inside a MS Word-like editor. This was meant to help with writing poetry, as the
        structure
        and symmetry of sounds play a big part.

        Design was also a big part. I gained inspiration from the UX flow of various applications and created context
        menus,
        menu bar buttons and responsive page layouts. Every padding and alignment was carefully designed to make the
        experience
        smooth and friendly.
