    <h2>Large Language Model APIs</h2>
    <p>With the ever-evolving landscape of AI technologies, application is key. Recently, I embarked on a project that
        merged the
        capabilities of generative AI with A/B testing to enhance music composition and poster design.</p>
    <p>I utilized OpenAI's API to generate diverse poster designs. This AI technology emulates human creativity,
        producing
        unique and engaging visuals. For music composition, I employed Suno's API, which excels in creating various
        musical
        pieces with different styles and elements. To determine the effectiveness of these creations, I ran my own A/B
        tests, allowing for simultaneous testing of multiple variations.</p>

    <div class="row panel">
        <img src="/img/p1.png" alt="ai generated poster">
        <img src="/img/p11.png" alt="ai generated poster">
        <img src="/img/p111.png" alt="ai generated poster">
    </div>

    <p>The process began with generating various musical pieces using Suno's API, exploring different genres and moods.
        Similarly, OpenAI's API created a range of poster designs, each with distinct themes and visual styles. I then
        set
        up and conducted A/B tests to compare these music and design variations in real-time. Monitoring the results
        closely, I identified which AI-generated music and posters resonated most with audiences.</p>

    <p>Based on the insights gained from the data, I refined the AI parameters and generated new variations for further
        testing. This iterative process demonstrated that combining generative AI with A/B testing not only streamlines
        the
        creative process but also provides valuable insights into audience preferences.</p>
