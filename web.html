    <h2>Full Stack Website (E-Commerce)</h2>

    <p>I designed and developed a <a href="https://aiedmusic.com/">music e-commerce website</a> from the ground up. For the frontend, I utilized HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript, along with <a class="underline" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/makel-dom">my own NPM module</a>, to structure and style the product listings and prices. The
        majority of user interactions were implemented using Vanilla JS, while customer payments were securely processed via
        the Stripe API and associated webhooks.</p>
    
    <p>On the backend, I created a custom server script to automate email receipt generation after each purchase.
        Additionally, I leveraged Express and Axios to facilitate product filtering and search functionalities, with product
        tags stored in metadata for efficient categorization.</p>
    
    <p>To ensure a cohesive and reusable design, I used Express and EJS to develop visual components for the shopping page,
        enabling consistent and flexible product displays across the site.</p>
